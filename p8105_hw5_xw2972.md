1. The first plot shows that the power of the test increases with the effect size (true μ).
   Power approaches 1 as μ increases, meaning the test is highly likely to reject the null hypothesis when the effect is large.

2. The second plot demonstrates:
   - The average μ̂ across all samples aligns closely with the true μ.
   - However, in samples where the null hypothesis is rejected (green line), the average μ̂ is consistently higher than the true μ.
   This occurs due to 'selection bias' or 'winner's curse', where significant results tend to overestimate the effect size due to random variation.
